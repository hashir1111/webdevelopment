	<h1>IQBAL's ALLAHBAD ADDRESS&lt;1940&gt;</h1>
	<p>Allama Iqbal defined the Muslim of India there could be no possibility of peace in the country unless and until they were recognized as a nation and under a federal system, the Muslim majority units were given the same privileges which were to be given to the Hindu majority units. It was the only way in which both the Muslims and the Hindus could prosper in accordance with their respective cultural values. In his speech, he emphasized that unlike Christianity, Islam came with &quot;legal concepts&quot; with &quot;civic significance,&quot; with its &quot;religious ideals&quot; considered as inseparable from social order: &quot;therefore, the construction of a policy on national lines, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim.&quot;</p>
