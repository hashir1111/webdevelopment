	<h1>Anatomy of CSS</h1>
	
	<h2>This is a sub-heading</h2>
	<p>Now, as I told you, a CSS rule can consist of several declarations. For example, in this case we're specifying the contents of the paragraph tags in our HTML page should have a particular color, a particular font size, and also be a particular width, meaning the paragraph itself, the content, should take up 200 pixels.</p>
	<h2>This is also a sub-heading</h2>
	<p>subheading 2, you can see that it is bold and it's a little bit bigger than the regular text would be. Now, where did that style come from? I certainly never specified what kind of styling to apply to, essentially, what is an h2 tag. Well, that styling came from the browser itself. Every browser comes with some default styles that it applies to different HTML elements.</p>
